# Halo Formula Student

**A Formula Student desktop companion for the JC4827W543 (ESP32-S3 + 4.3" TFT)**

Halo Formula Student is a small, always-on display that shows key Formula Student event sessions in your local timezone and team ELO rankings, with special focus on Germany, Spain and Czech Republic events.

The pre-compiled firmware is free to install from the [project website](https://halof1.com/). This repository contains the full source code for reference and personal use.

## Features

- **Session Times** — FP1, FP2, FP3, Sprint Qualifying, Sprint Race, Qualifying and Race start times for the upcoming weekend, automatically converted to your local timezone
- **Drivers' Championship** — Full standings table updated throughout the season; includes a pre-season fallback that populates the driver and constructor roster before the first race
- **Session Results** — Qualifying (Q1/Q2/Q3) and race results fetched from the live OpenF1 API, including gap to leader
- **No Spoiler Mode** — No unwanted spoilers when watching live sessions isn't an option!

## Flashing

The easiest way to install the firmware is via the project website, directly from Chrome or Edge — no software needed:

**[halof1.com](https://halof1.com/)**

If you want to compile from source, see the [Building from Source](#building-from-source) section below.

**Important:** Make sure to install the ipex antenna on the back of the board, this board won't be able to maintain a stable WiFi connection without it.

---

## Building from Source

### Requirements

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) 2.x
- ESP32 Arduino core (`esp32` by Espressif, tested on **3.x**)

### Arduino Libraries

Install the following through the Library Manager (Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries).
**IMPORTANT:** This project has been developed over an extended period of time, libraries used in it might have introduced breaking changes in latest updates. To ensure full compatibility please make sure to download the correct versions where indicated

| Library             | Author          |
| ------------------- | --------------- |
| `LVGL v9.3`         | LVGL            |
| `WiFiManager`       | tzapu           |
| `ArduinoJson`       | Benoit Blanchon |
| `bb_spi_lcd v2.7.1` | Larry Bank      |

> **Note:** `lv_conf.h` must be configured for the JC4827W543 display before compiling. The `lv_conf.h` included in this repository is already set up correctly.

### Pin Configuration

The following defines are set at the top of `F1Halo.ino` and match the JC4827W543 board:

```cpp
#define DISPLAY_TYPE    DISPLAY_CYD_543
#define TOUCH_CAPACITIVE
#define TOUCH_SDA        8
#define TOUCH_SCL        4
#define TOUCH_INT        3
#define TOUCH_RST       -1
#define TOUCH_MOSI      11
#define TOUCH_MISO      13
#define TOUCH_CLK       12
#define TOUCH_CS        38
#define SCREEN_WIDTH   272
#define SCREEN_HEIGHT  480
```

### Compiling and Uploading

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `F1Halo.ino` in Arduino IDE
3. If your board is Capacitive Touch, make sure `#define TOUCH_CAPACITIVE` is set, otherwise comment it out to compile for Resistive Touch
4. Select **ESP32S3 Dev Module** as the target board
5. Set **Flash Size** to **4MB**, **PSRAM** to **OPI PSRAM** (8 MB), and **Partition Scheme** to `Huge APP (3MB No OTA/1MB SPIFFS)`. Set **USB CDC On Boot** to **enabled** to get Serial feed via USB
6. Connect the board via a USB-A to USB-C data cable
7. If the port does not appear, hold `BOOT`, press `RST`, then release `BOOT` to enter flash mode
8. Click **Upload**

## Data Sources

Halo Formula Student fetches all data over HTTPS. No account or API key is required.

| Data                          | Source                                       |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Team ELO rankings             | FSELO (`fselo.get-racing.de`) with local fallback |
| Event calendar & session times| Built-in Formula Student event calendar (DE/ES/CZ focus) |
| Live session results          | Not available (organizer APIs are not public) |
| Timezone offset from IP       | [IP API](https://ipapi.co/)                  |
| Weather Forecast              | [Open Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/)        |
| News headlines                | The Race — RSS feed                          |

### Anonymous Statistics

On startup, and periodically, the device sends a minimal anonymous ping to a server at `we-race.it`. This request carries:

- A randomly generated device UUID (generated once, stored in flash)
- The selected display language
- The configured UTC offset
- The current firmware version

No personal data, Wi-Fi credentials, location or network information is ever transmitted. This telemetry is used solely to count active installs, check for firmware updates and deliver in-app notifications such as release announcements. You can verify this behaviour yourself in the `sendStatisticData()` function inside `wifi_handler.h`.
